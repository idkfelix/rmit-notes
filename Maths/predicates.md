## Predicates
- A logical statement with a truth value that is a function of one or more variables is called a **predicate**
- Predicates differ from propositions as they do not have a well defined truth value until the value of the variables are specified
    - The statement "$\large x$ is an odd number" is not a proposition because the statement does not have a well defined truth value until the value of $\large x$ is specified. If $\large x=5$ the statement is true, however if $\large x=4$ then it is false.
- These statements can be expressed as a function $\large{p}$ of the variable $\large{x}$, as in $\large{P(x)}$ read as $\large{P}$ of $\large{x}$.
- If the **predicate** $\large{P(x)}$ is defined to be the statement "$\large{x}$ is an odd number," then $\large{P(5)}$ corresponds to the statement "$\large{5}$ is an odd number". This is considered a **proposition** as $\large{P(5)}$ has a well-defined truth value

## Variable Domains
- The **domain** of a variable in a predicate is the set of all possible values for the variable. 
- For example, a natural domain for the variable $\large{x}$ in the predicate "$\large{x}$ is an odd number" is the set of all integers or $\large{\mathbb{Z}}$
- If the domain of a variable in a predicate is not clear from the context, the domain should be given as a part of the definition of the predicate
- A statement $\large{P(x)}$ may be true for all values in the domain, however if the statement contains a variable it is still considered to be a predicate not a proposition.
